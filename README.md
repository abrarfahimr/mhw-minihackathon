# MonsterHunterWorld-Mini Hackathon

This project is a mini monster dictionary that I did with my colleague Micheal Rideout for a mini hackathon at BrainStation. The hackathon required us to use HTML, SASS, and Vanilla Javascript to create an interactive side by pulling data from an api of choice in 5 HOURS. The api we chose was the monster hunter world unofficial api (https://mhw-db.com/monsters) that has detailed information on each monster in the game. The project focused on execution rather than features so that we can have a working website by the end of 5 hours. 

The focus of the side is to dynamically generate information of each monster with a click of the button. To help move through the list we scripted event handlers onto the back and next button to make clicking through slides more intuitive. However, one issue we faced was that the API did not have images of the monster so we had to hard code the data and dynamically append them using javascript. The landing page has audio that plays by clicking on the button to be more interactive to the user.

Overall for my first Hackathon I enjoyed the creative projects that people came up with. Hackathons are really intense with 5 hours of non-stop coding but it pushed me to find solutions faster and test more.
